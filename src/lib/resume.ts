	summary: `Hey ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m an international student from Ethiopia. Right now, Iâ€™m doing my placement at Matillion, working on everything from repo migrations, incident management to internal tooling. Before that, I was keeping VR systems alive (and customers happy) at Otherworld. Outside of work, I love building random projects â€” currently designing a bible reading app for the Ethiopian Orthodox version. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me learning Spanish, kicking pads at Muay Thai, or watching an obscure anime`,
