	summary: `Hey ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m an Ethiopian currently in the UK as an international student and a software engineer whoâ€™s constantly tinkering with ideas that blend culture, creativity, and code. Right now, Iâ€™m at Matillion, working on everything from repo migrations to internal tooling. Before that, I was keeping VR systems alive (and customers happy) at Otherworld. Outside of work, I love building random projects â€” currently designing a website that celebrates Ethiopian food and culture, mixing recipes, history, and where to find real ingredients. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me learning Spanish, training Muay Thai, or diving into anime`,
